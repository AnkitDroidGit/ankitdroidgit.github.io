## Creating A GitHub Profile

Github says

AnkitDroidGit/AnkitDroidGit is now a special repository: its README.md will appear on your profile!

GitHub recently released a feature that allows users to create a profile README to display prominently on their GitHub profile.
This write-up explains how to access this new feature and create your own special repository.

## Letâ€™s Start !!

The profile README is created by creating a new repository with the same name as your username.
Let's understand with my example:
My GitHub username is AnkitDroidGit so I created a new repository with the name AnkitDroidGit.
Note: new repository name must match (including letter case) your GitHub username.

### Let's follow the steps

1. Create a new repository with the same name (including casing) as your GitHub username: https://github.com/new
1. Let it be public.
1. Initialize this repository with a README.
1. Modify README.md file inside the repo with your content (text, GIFs, images, emojis, etc.)
1. Commit your README!
1. Push changes to GitHub (if you made changes locally).

And finally, you will get a profile read me like mine.
